## Welcome, this is my project the Pricing Test.

- Conduct AB testing (t-test) to determine the pricing strategy for a software product and improve the revenue by 18%
- Run chi-squared tests to address variable correlations and ensure random splitting of experimental and control groups
- Perform feature analysis to manage the tradeoff between price and volume and derive actionable insights, including launching special marketing programs and examining incompatibility issues, for subsets of users

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/shdai12/shdai.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
